\item{n}{integer vector, named with \code{"enrolled","randomized"} and optionally also including treatment levels.}

\item{nobsY}{a result of the the \code{nobsY} Hmisc function}

\item{table}{set to \code{TRUE} to return as an attribute \code{"table"} a character string containing a LaTeX tabular showing the pertinent frequencies created from \code{n} and the \code{denom} option, and if \code{nobsY} is present, adding another table with response variable-specific counts.}
